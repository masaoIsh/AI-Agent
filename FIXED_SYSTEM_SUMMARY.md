### 🔧 **Fix Applied:**
- Changed `"Dr. Sarah Chen"` → `"Dr_Sarah_Chen"`
- Changed `"Dr. Marcus Rodriguez"` → `"Dr_Marcus_Rodriguez"`  
- Changed `"Dr. Priya Patel"` → `"Dr_Priya_Patel"`
- Updated display logic to show proper names to users

🧮 Dr. Sarah Chen (Fundamental Analyst):
Initial Recommendation: SELL

**Fundamental Analysis Summary for AAPL:**

**Concerning Factors:**
• **Revenue Growth:** Declining growth to 4% YoY raises questions about market saturation
• **Valuation Concerns:** High P/E ratio of 25x vs industry average of 22x suggests overvaluation
• **Financial Stress:** Increasing debt-to-equity ratio to 0.7x shows deteriorating capital structure
• **Profitability Issues:** Negative free cash flow trends and contracting margins

**Financial Health Indicators:**
• Gross margin: 36%
• Operating margin: -2%
• ROE: 2%
