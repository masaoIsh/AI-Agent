# âœ… 3-Round System Implementation Complete!

## ðŸŽ¯ **Changes Made to `interactive_cli.py`**

### **Updated Debate Configuration:**
- **Before:** 2 rounds per agent (6 total turns)
- **After:** 3 rounds per agent (9 total turns)
- **Termination:** Automatic after each agent speaks 3 times

### **Key Changes:**

1. **âœ… Maximum Turns Updated:**
```python
# Before
debate_team = RoundRobinGroupChat(agent_list, max_turns=6)  # 2 rounds per agent

# After  
debate_team = RoundRobinGroupChat(agent_list, max_turns=9)  # 3 rounds per agent
```

2. **âœ… Updated Instructions:**
```
Instructions:
1. Each agent will speak a maximum of 3 times in total (3 rounds of discussion)
2. In your first turn, provide your initial analysis and recommendation
3. In subsequent turns, respond to other agents and work towards consensus
4. Listen to other agents' perspectives and engage in constructive debate
5. Challenge assumptions and ask probing questions
6. Look for common ground and areas of agreement
7. Work towards building a consensus recommendation
8. The discussion will automatically terminate after each agent has spoken 3 times
9. If consensus cannot be reached, provide a majority recommendation with minority views
```

3. **âœ… Turn Tracking (Already Correct):**
```python
round_num = ((turn_counter - 1) // 3) + 1
turn_in_round = ((turn_counter - 1) % 3) + 1
```

## ðŸš€ **How the 3-Round System Works**

### **Round Structure:**
- **Round 1:** Initial analyses and recommendations
- **Round 2:** Consensus building and debate
- **Round 3:** Final consensus and conclusion

### **Turn Sequence:**
```
Turn 1: Wassim (Fundamental Agent) - Round 1, Turn 1
Turn 2: Khizar (Sentiment Agent) - Round 1, Turn 1  
Turn 3: Yugo (Valuation Agent) - Round 1, Turn 1
Turn 4: Wassim (Fundamental Agent) - Round 2, Turn 2
Turn 5: Khizar (Sentiment Agent) - Round 2, Turn 2
Turn 6: Yugo (Valuation Agent) - Round 2, Turn 2
Turn 7: Wassim (Fundamental Agent) - Round 3, Turn 3
Turn 8: Khizar (Sentiment Agent) - Round 3, Turn 3
Turn 9: Yugo (Valuation Agent) - Round 3, Turn 3
â†’ AUTOMATIC TERMINATION
```
