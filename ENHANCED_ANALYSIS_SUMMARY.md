### 5. **Enhanced Debate Responses**
Agents now provide **detailed, professional responses** during debates:

```
ðŸ§® Dr. Sarah Chen:
I appreciate your perspectives, but I must emphasize that fundamental analysis provides the bedrock for any investment decision. While sentiment and valuation are important, the underlying financial health of the company cannot be ignored. My analysis shows strong revenue growth, healthy margins, and a robust balance sheet that supports long-term value creation.

ðŸ“Š Dr. Marcus Rodriguez:
I respect the fundamental analysis, but market sentiment is often a leading indicator that shouldn't be dismissed. The current sentiment landscape shows clear directional bias that can drive significant price movements. While fundamentals matter, investor psychology and market dynamics often determine short to medium-term returns.

ðŸ“ˆ Dr. Priya Patel:
From a quantitative valuation perspective, my models suggest the current price doesn't adequately reflect intrinsic value. While I appreciate the fundamental and sentiment arguments, valuation analysis provides an objective framework for assessing risk-adjusted returns. The math simply doesn't support the current valuation levels.
```
