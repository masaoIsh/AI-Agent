2. In your first turn, provide your initial analysis and recommendation
3. In subsequent turns, respond to other agents and work towards consensus
4. Listen to other agents' perspectives and engage in constructive debate
5. Challenge assumptions and ask probing questions
6. Look for common ground and areas of agreement
7. Work towards building a consensus recommendation
8. The discussion will automatically terminate after each agent has spoken 3 times
9. If consensus cannot be reached, provide a majority recommendation with minority views
