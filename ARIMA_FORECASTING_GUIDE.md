## 📊 Core Functions

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing

#### `load_csv_data(file_path, date_column=None, value_column=None)`

**Purpose**: Load and preprocess time series data from CSV files

**Parameters**:
- `file_path` (str): Path to CSV file
- `date_column` (str): Name of date column (auto-detected if None)
- `value_column` (str): Name of value column (auto-detected if None)

**Features**:
- **Smart CSV Detection**: Handles malformed headers and title rows
- **Auto Column Detection**: Automatically identifies date and value columns
- **Error Recovery**: Multiple fallback strategies for problematic files
- **Data Validation**: Ensures proper data types and formats

**Supported Date Columns**: `timeOpen`, `timeClose`, `timestamp`, `date`, `time`
**Supported Value Columns**: `close`, `price`, `value`, `open`, `high`, `low`

**Example**:
```python
forecaster = ARIMAForecaster()
success = forecaster.load_csv_data('/path/to/stock_data.csv')
# Auto-detects: timeOpen as date, close as value
```

#### `_detect_date_column()` and `_detect_value_column()`

**Purpose**: Intelligent column detection for various CSV formats

**Logic**:
- Scans column names for keywords
- Prioritizes common financial data patterns
- Handles different naming conventions (camelCase, snake_case, etc.)

### 2. Statistical Analysis

#### `check_stationarity()`

**Purpose**: Test if time series is stationary using Augmented Dickey-Fuller test

**Returns**:
- ADF Statistic
- p-value
- Critical values
- Stationary status (True/False)

**Interpretation**:
- **p-value < 0.05**: Series is stationary
- **p-value ≥ 0.05**: Series is non-stationary (needs differencing)

#### `make_stationary()`

**Purpose**: Convert non-stationary series to stationary using differencing

**Process**:
1. Try first difference (d=1)
2. Test stationarity of differenced series
3. If needed, try second difference (d=2)
4. Update series and store differencing level

**Returns**: Success status and differencing level used

### 3. Model Optimization

#### `find_optimal_arima_params(max_p=5, max_d=2, max_q=5)`

**Purpose**: Automatically find optimal ARIMA parameters using AIC criterion

**Process**:
- Grid search over parameter combinations
- Fits models for each (p,d,q) combination
- Selects parameters with lowest AIC
- Handles convergence failures gracefully

**Parameters**:
- `max_p`: Maximum autoregressive terms
- `max_d`: Maximum differencing
- `max_q`: Maximum moving average terms

**Returns**: Optimal (p,d,q) tuple and corresponding AIC

#### `fit_arima_model(order=None)`

**Purpose**: Fit ARIMA model to the time series

**Process**:
- Uses optimal parameters if not specified
- Fits the model with error handling
- Stores fitted model and diagnostics
- Provides model performance metrics

**Returns**: Success status and model performance (AIC, BIC, Log-Likelihood)

### 4. Forecasting

#### `forecast(periods=30, confidence_level=0.95)`

**Purpose**: Generate multi-period forecasts with confidence intervals

**Parameters**:
- `periods`: Number of forecast periods (default: 30)
- `confidence_level`: Confidence level for intervals (default: 95%)

**Output**:
- Forecast values
- Confidence intervals
- Forecast dates
- Statistical confidence metrics

**Returns**: Dictionary containing all forecast results

### 5. Analysis and Reporting

#### `generate_analysis_report()`

**Purpose**: Create comprehensive analysis report

**Report Sections**:
1. **Data Summary**: Points, date range, mean, standard deviation
2. **Model Parameters**: ARIMA order and performance metrics
3. **Forecast Summary**: Forecast statistics and trends
4. **Confidence Intervals**: Statistical confidence bounds
